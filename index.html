<p>Hi Elijah Melton,</p>
    
    <p>
        Thank you for submitting your feedback last week, and sorry these emails are coming out a bit late. You've
        been paired with Elijah Melton for this week's interviews, and you will be interviewing them on
        <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/description">Insert Interval</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please reach out to them through Discord at elimelt or email at elimelt@uw.edu to
        schedule a time to meet. 
    </p>

    <p>
        There are not that many patterns associated with interval problems, so instead of reccomending any particular
        resources I suggest you just practice a few problems on your own. If you're looking for a problem to practice
        with, I suggest <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/">this one</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Best of luck!
    </p>
